## 📁 Repository Structure

 | 🔸 Description                                  
|----------------------------------------------------|

->  Python OOP concepts: class, objects, methods     
-> Dictionary creation, methods, key-value usage     
->  Reading, writing, and manipulating files        
-> Built-in and user-defined functions   
->  List operations, indexing, slicing, methods  
-> String manipulation, formatting, and operations  
-> Tuple declaration and method usage  

---

## _Key Program Topics_

### Class  
-> Class & Object basics  
-> Constructor & destructors  
->  Method types: static, class, instance  

### Dictionary  
-> Creation and update of dictionaries  
-> Key iteration, values, `.get()`, `.items()`  

### File Handling  
-> Open, read, write files  
-> File modes (`r`, `w`, `a`)  
-> File pointer functions (`seek()`, `tell()`)  

### Function  
-> `def`, arguments, return  
-> Lambda functions  
-> Recursion  

### List  
-> List creation and comprehension  
-> List methods (`append()`, `remove()`, etc.)  
-> Nested lists and loops  

### String  
-> String slicing, immutability  
-> String methods (`split()`, `join()`, `replace()`)  

### Tuple  
-> Tuple immutability  
-> Tuple packing & unpacking  
-> Indexing and methods  

---

##  Learning Objectives

-> Understand Python’s core syntax and structure  
-> Apply object-oriented concepts like encapsulation and constructors  
-> Work with data structures: List, Tuple, Dict  
-> Master file operations for text and data files  
-> Improve function design with recursion and lambda  
-> Prepare for Python-based job roles, automation, and testing  
-> Build a strong foundation for backend or AI/ML development

### Requirements

- Python 3.x installed (Recommended: 3.8+)  
- Any code editor: VS Code / PyCharm / Jupyter / IDLE
